# Operations Command Manual

This document only records commands confirmed to be executable in the current repository and current Jetson environment.

## Initial Setup

All commands below rely on the following conditions:
1. The robot repository is cloned into a folder `~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle`
2. The robot has ROS2 Humble installed
3. `~/.bashrc` matches exactly the version in [/scripts/.bashrc](/scripts/.bashrc)

To create the directory, run:
```bash
cd ~/
mkdir XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle
cd ~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle
```

To install ROS2 Humble, follow their [official documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Alternatives/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html).

To set `~/.bashrc` for the first time:
- Copy the contents of [/scripts/.bashrc](/scripts/.bashrc) into your clipboard
- SSH into the Jetson
- Run:
```bash
vi ~/.bashrc
```
- Then, type `:%d`, press `Enter`
- Then, paste your clipboard contents
- After, press `Esc`, then type `:wq`, press `Enter`
- You should be back to the terminal. Run:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 1. Build and Source

```bash
# Initial dependency setup
make setup

# Full build
make build

# Layered build
make build-bringup
make build-fastlio2

bash scripts/init_runtime_data.sh

ls ~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data
```

## 3. Launch Operating Modes

```bash
make launch-slam
make launch-explore

make launch-corridor
make launch-travel
make launch-explore-gps
make launch-nav-gps
make launch-nav-gps
make launch-rtk-basic

bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh slam

# Enable RTK only when outdoor Fixed samples are needed for later indoor/outdoor geo-registration
ros2 launch bringup system_slam.launch.py use_rtk:=true

# A lean evidence bag is recorded under the session's slam_bag/ by default; debug adds raw Livox/structural clouds
FYP_SLAM_BAG_PROFILE=debug bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh slam
# Disable recording only for temporary smoke tests, not formal acceptance
FYP_SLAM_RECORD_BAG=false bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh slam
```

One-line command for indoor click-to-go navigation without GPS:

> Compatibility note: `FYP_*` names are legacy runtime interface variables still read by the current scripts. This documentation pass updates public project wording, not runtime interface names.

```bash
FYP_USE_RVIZ=true bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh indoor-nav
```

Notes:
- `indoor-nav` does not start the GNSS driver, `gps_global_aligner`, or `gps_route_runner`
- It keeps Livox, FAST-LIO2, PGO, Nav2, and the serial control chain running
- In RViz, use `2D Goal Pose` to publish goals to `/goal_pose` for indoor click-to-go navigation

One-line command for prior-map Travel navigation:

```bash
FYP_USE_RVIZ=true bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh travel \
  map_bundle:=/home/badger/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_id>
```

Travel records a navigation diagnostic rosbag for every launch session at
`runtime-data/logs/latest/data/travel_bag/` by default. The lean profile captures goals,
navigation status, TF, FAST-LIO2/chassis odometry, global/local paths, costmaps, laser
scan, and all four velocity-command stages. This is enough to diagnose weaving, stops,
and recoveries without recording raw Livox point clouds. Use the debug profile when the
point-cloud obstacle input must also be replayed:

```bash
FYP_TRAVEL_BAG_PROFILE=debug FYP_USE_RVIZ=false FYP_USE_FOXGLOVE=true \
  bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh travel \
  map_bundle:=/home/badger/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/maps/indoor/floor_4

# Disable automatic recording only when replay evidence is explicitly unnecessary
FYP_TRAVEL_RECORD_BAG=false bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh travel \
  map_bundle:=/home/badger/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/maps/indoor/floor_4
```

Notes:
- `map_bundle` is the production input. Travel checks schema, `consistency_ok`, calibration acceptance, and the 2D map, localization PCD, alignment, descriptor, and destination artifacts. Separate `map_yaml/pcd_map` arguments remain only for compatibility debugging
- `prior_map_tf_authority` is Travel's sole `map -> odom` publisher. The localizer supplies the initial 3D candidate, AMCL supplies runtime 2D prior-map candidates, and FAST-LIO2 owns `odom -> base_footprint`
- Startup queries several Scan Context candidates and refines them with ICP. Ambiguity before the first accepted pose still blocks motion. Once the authority owns a valid TF, a transient background `LOST/ambiguous_global_candidates` state neither overwrites that TF nor stops the vehicle by itself; AMCL, sensor health, and authority health become the runtime gates
- After localizer acceptance, its latched `map -> odom` seed initializes both the authority and AMCL. AMCL candidates pass covariance, timestamp, and `0.75m/0.45rad` target-jump gates before a five-sample window takes the median of at least three consistent candidates. A stable target is accepted at most once per second with independent `0.05m/0.035rad` deadbands. The published TF then approaches it only on the 20Hz timer under `0.015m/s`, `0.006rad/s`, and `0.02m/s` equivalent-base correction-rate limits instead of taking centimetre steps in the AMCL callback
- Travel also starts `nav2_cloud_retime.py`; the local costmap reads `/fastlio2/body_cloud_nav2`, a current-stamp copy of `/fastlio2/body_cloud_nav2_obstacles`, while the global costmap plans on the static 2D map and `localizer`/mapping nodes keep using the original `/fastlio2/body_cloud`
- The global static layer clears stale map occupancy only below the robot's current measured footprint, preventing a map speck or small TF offset from locking NavFn's start in the inscribed zone. Static obstacles outside the footprint and all local-costmap, MPPI, and Collision Monitor safety checks remain intact
- Travel's bounded-recovery trees replan at `1Hz`. If local clearing and replanning still fail, a footprint-collision-checked `0.20m` backup at `0.08m/s` is attempted and followed immediately by another replan; conditional `0.52rad` Spin and wait/final clearing remain later actions. Normal MPPI tracking keeps `vx_min=0`, so ordinary paths cannot oscillate between forward and reverse
- MPPI uses a matched `15Hz/model_dt=0.0666667s` with `time_steps=24`, `batch_size=128`, and an approximately `1.6s` horizon to reduce single-core deadline pressure. PathAlign weight `6` and PathFollow weight `12` permit natural local detours. Rotation Shim only handles path errors above `0.65rad` at `0.24rad/s`, does not own final heading alignment, and uses `closed_loop=false` so its command ramps across cycles and crosses chassis static friction
- The post-processor no longer amplifies any small angular command. It removes translation only after Collision Monitor confirms slowdown, linear speed falls below the `0.14m/s` breakaway range, and angular speed is at least `0.16rad/s`; the original angular command is preserved. `PoseProgressChecker` still counts `0.15rad` rotation as progress
- Before sending a goal, run `ros2 topic echo /chassis/status --once`; it must report `ctrl_mode: 0` (host serial mode). `ctrl_mode: 1` is gamepad mode and `ctrl_mode: 2` is motor-disabled/safety takeover. The adapter rejects goals in those states so enabling motors cannot unexpectedly release an already active goal
- Travel's final serial limiter constrains acceleration recovery only; zero and deceleration remain immediate. Linear/angular recovery limits are `0.30m/s2` and `0.80rad/s2`, removing command jumps when Collision Monitor releases a Stop
- The velocity gate requires a localizer sensor status within 0.5s with `sensors_ready=true`, authority status within 0.6s with `tf_active=true`, `/fastlio2/body_cloud_nav2` within 0.5s, and no more than 0.40s between `/cmd_vel` messages. `/travel/control_gate/status` and `/diagnostics` identify `LOCALIZATION_*`, `POINTCLOUD_TIMEOUT`, `COLLISION_STOP/SLOWDOWN`, or `COMMAND_TIMEOUT`
- The authority republishes TF at `20Hz` with `0.10s` future tolerance. A new `/initialpose` makes `tf_active=false` until manual relocalization succeeds. With an existing trusted TF, transient localizer candidate ambiguity enters degraded hold without replacing the TF or stopping navigation that remains corrected by AMCL
- Automatic global localization waits for at least 200 structural points and retries up to five times at 3s intervals; `map -> odom` is always projected to planar XY+yaw
- PGO is off by default; if `use_pgo:=true` is passed, it uses `pgo_slam.yaml` and does not publish TF

Localization status and region-assisted relocalization:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /localizer/status
ros2 topic echo /travel/prior_map_tf/status
ros2 topic echo /travel/control_gate/status
ros2 service call /localizer/global_relocalize interface/srv/GlobalRelocalize \
  "{descriptor_index: '', region: 'east_corridor', max_candidates: 5}"
```

RViz `2D Pose Estimate` remains a manual fallback. The legacy service can also be called directly:

Travel follows `/initialpose` semantics and interprets its pose values as map coordinates. If
Foxglove labels the message with its current display frame, such as `base_link`, the bridge logs
a warning and normalizes it to `map` before sending it to localizer and AMCL. A TF conversion is
not possible here because `map -> base_link` does not exist before initial localization.

```bash
ros2 service call /localizer/relocalize interface/srv/Relocalize \
  "{pcd_path: '/home/badger/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_id>/localization/map_localization.pcd', x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, yaw: 0.0, pitch: 0.0, roll: 0.0}"
```

Named navigation without RViz:

```bash
ros2 action send_goal /navigate_named_destination \
  interface/action/NavigateNamedDestination \
  "{map_id: '<map_id>', destination_name: 'lab 101', backend: 'indoor'}" --feedback
```

Verification:

```bash
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_monitor odom base_footprint
ros2 service call /localizer/relocalize_check interface/srv/IsValid "{code: 0}"
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_monitor map odom
ros2 topic echo /amcl_pose --once
ros2 topic echo /travel/prior_map_tf/status --once
ros2 topic echo /travel/control_gate/status --once
ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel_safe
```

One-line command for GPS Corridor v2:

```bash
FYP_USE_RVIZ=true bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh corridor
```

Notes:
- Corridor-specific route capture, startup watchdog, and runtime behavior are documented in Section 14
- The wrapper maintains both session logs and the foreground status monitor output

One-line command for autonomous survey mapping:

```bash
bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh survey
```

Notes:
- The Survey mode automatically explores unknown areas within a confined radius (`max_radius`) from the initial odometry frame `(0,0,0)`.
- It queries a map-matching service comparing the active SLAM map to the saved map database.
- It features 4 logic states visible in the node logs:
  - `Autonomous_Exploration`: Commands navigation to frontiers. Rejects goals outside `max_radius`.
  - `Hypothesis_Testing`: Suspends frontier exploration to confirm localization at a known coordinate.
  - `Pure_Mapping`: Initiated if the active map exceeds `threshold_x` area without a match. Disables map-matching. Maps everything within `max_radius`.
  - `Return_To_Home`: On confirmation or fully mapped, navigates back to `(0,0,0)` safely.

Logs to expect:
- The Survey Node logs can be viewed directly using this command while it is running:
  ```bash
  ros2 topic echo /rosout | grep survey_node
  ```
  Alternatively, you can view the log file stored in the session directory:
  ```bash
  cat ~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/logs/latest/console/survey_node.log
  ```
- Look for state transition logs in the terminal output. Messages include `Survey node initialized in state: ...`, `Match score ... >= guess threshold. Transitioning to Hypothesis_Testing`, `Goal rejected: exceeds MAX_RADIUS`, and `Fully mapped within radius. Transitioning to Return_To_Home`.

- Whether `/gps_system/status` has reached `NAV_READY`
- Whether `/gnss` contains valid scene-calibrated GNSS data published by `gps_anchor_localizer`
- Whether `/compute_route` / `/follow_path` / `/navigate_to_pose` actions are online
- Whether the RViz fixed frame is set to `map`

```

## 8. Map Saving

```bash
# Stop the vehicle, then generate and validate the full indoor map bundle
scripts/save_mapping_session.sh <map_name>
# Optional: label descriptor candidates with region polygons
python3 scripts/save_mapping_session.py <map_name> --regions-file /path/to/regions.yaml
# Recompute only calibration/overlay/descriptor region labels/manifest without ROS save calls
scripts/save_mapping_session.sh <map_name> --recalibrate-only

# Remove only isolated occupied components up to three cells from a saved PGM.
# Always write a new image and inspect it before replacing the active map.
python3 scripts/clean_occupancy_map.py \
  runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/navigation/map.pgm \
  runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/navigation/map.cleaned.pgm
```

Output:

```text
runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/manifest.yaml
runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/navigation/{map.yaml,map.pgm,slam_toolbox.posegraph,slam_toolbox.data}
runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/localization/{map_raw.pcd,map_localization.pcd,poses.txt}
runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/localization/patches/*.pcd
runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/localization/descriptor_index/scan_context.yaml
runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/calibration/{map_3d_to_map_2d.yaml,alignment_report.yaml,alignment_overlay.png}
runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/{destinations.yaml,regions.yaml}
```

Notes:
- Saving checks FAST-LIO2 and `/odom_CBoar` twice while stationary; if live `/cmd_vel` is observed it must also be zero. Any hard-gate failure returns nonzero, and Travel rejects `consistency_ok=false`
- 2D-to-3D calibration no longer projects the complete PCD. It keeps strong wall cells containing at least three points over a `>=0.50m` vertical span in a `0.06m` XY grid, rejecting floors, tabletops, and single-height dynamic clutter. These defaults correspond to the default `0.10m` localization-PCD voxel
- `--recalibrate-only` preserves the original `created_at`, save outputs, stationary/frame/patch evidence, and map assets. It atomically replaces only the manifest while rebuilding calibration files, overlay, and Scan Context region labels
- Initial 2D-to-3D gates require global and configured-region wall RMSE `<=0.10m`, p95 `<=0.15m`, overlap `>=0.55`, and a first/second seed gap `>=0.001`; calibrate them from vehicle maps before acceptance
- `patch_pose_integrity.ok` must be `true`, meaning `patches/*.pcd` and `poses.txt` keyframes are one-to-one
- `frame_check.ok` must be `true`; by default `/scan.header.frame_id` and `/fastlio2/lio_odom.child_frame_id` are expected to be `base_footprint`. If the vehicle's FAST-LIO2 child frame is different, confirm it with `view_frames`/`tf2_echo` first, then save with `--expected-base-frame <frame>`
- Later indoor/outdoor geo-registration must use RTK Fixed samples plus heading; indoor invalid/float RTK samples are records only, not strong constraints
- Isolated-point cleanup uses 8-connectivity and defaults to occupied components of only one to three cells (`0.0025~0.0075m2`). It restores each component from its boundary majority as either free or unknown, never paints all unknown edges free, and preserves columns, furniture, and walls larger than three cells. Back up `map.pgm` and inspect the result before replacing the active image

Low-level troubleshooting commands:

```bash
# Confirm TF and frame names before saving; do not change base_frame blindly.
ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames
ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo odom base_footprint

# Save 3D point cloud map; file_path must be absolute because ROS service requests do not expand ~
ros2 service call /pgo/save_maps interface/srv/SaveMaps "{file_path: '/home/badger/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/localization', save_patches: true}"

# Save 2D occupancy grid map
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_name>/navigation/map --ros-args -p map_subscribe_transient_local:=true

# View PCD
pcl_viewer -bc 1,1,1 -ps 3 <map.pcd>
```

## 9. Stop System and Emergency Stop

```bash
# Clean up after system shutdown to ensure a clean state for the next launch
make kill
```

Stop and emergency-stop priority:

1. PS2 gamepad `X` button disables motors as the highest-priority software stop
2. Red physical emergency stop button on the vehicle body overrides all software commands

The lower-controller `B` button path now performs damped active braking: it keeps motor control enabled, applies current opposite to wheel speed, preserves a high current limit at higher speed for short stopping distance, tapers current at low speed, rate-limits current changes, then clears state and keeps sending zero-current frames near stop. The `B` brake latch initializes only on the first trigger, so holding `B` does not repeatedly clear the current ramp; the `B` indication is solid pink and no longer uses a blocking blink. Do not use `B` as a replacement for `X` or the red physical e-stop until bench and vehicle validation are complete.

## 10. Git and PR

```bash
# Sync main
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only

# Create branch
git checkout -b <BRANCH_NAME>

# Check status
git status
git branch -v
git log --oneline -5

# Push branch
git push -u origin <BRANCH_NAME>
```

GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh auth status
gh pr create
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
```

If `gh auth status` on the Jetson returns an invalid token, you can run `gh pr create` / `gh pr merge` on a local workstation that is already logged into GitHub CLI for the same branch, then return to the Jetson to execute:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only
git fetch --prune
```

## 11. System Maintenance

```bash
# Disk / memory
df -h /
free -h
htop

# Disk usage per folder
sudo du -h --max-depth=1 / | sort -hr

# JetPack / model
cat /etc/nv_tegra_release
cat /proc/device-tree/model

# NetworkManager and wired interface auto-start status
systemctl is-enabled NetworkManager
systemctl is-active NetworkManager
nmcli -t -f NAME,AUTOCONNECT,AUTOCONNECT-PRIORITY,DEVICE connection show --active

# Set network autoconnection settings
sudo nmcli connection modify "WiFi-Name" connection.autoconnect yes
sudo nmcli connection modify "WiFi-Name" connection.autoconnect-priority 100
sudo nmcli connection modify "WiFi-Name" connection.autoconnect-retries 3

# Check if current machine has passwordless sudo
sudo -n true && echo sudo_ok

# Switch Jetson WiFi and restart ToDesk on the Jetson side (execute directly on the Linux host)
bash scripts/switch_jetson_wifi.sh --status
bash scripts/switch_jetson_wifi.sh
bash scripts/switch_jetson_wifi.sh outdoor
bash scripts/switch_jetson_wifi.sh indoor
bash scripts/switch_jetson_wifi.sh Pixel
bash scripts/switch_jetson_wifi.sh XJTLU

# GPS dispatcher dependencies
apt list --installed | grep ros-humble-geographic-msgs
python3 -c "import pyproj; print(pyproj.__version__)"
```

Notes:
- Without arguments, the script toggles between `XJTLU` and `Pixel` by default
- The commands above are complete one-line commands to run directly on the Jetson / Linux host
- `pyproj` remains the recommended dependency; if it is temporarily missing, QGIS scene compilation and nav-gps scene loading fall back to a local ENU approximation instead of failing at startup
- When the script runs locally on the Jetson, it automatically switches to local mode; if the current shell is SSH/Tailscale, the session may disconnect during the network switch
- Each network switch restarts `todeskd` on the Jetson side, with logs written to `/tmp/wifi-switch.log`

## 12. GPS Data Collection

Minimum two-line launch commands:

```bash
ros2 launch nmea_navsat_driver nmea_serial_driver.launch.py params_file:=/home/jetson/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/src/bringup/config/master_params.yaml
python3 scripts/collect_gps_scene.py
```

```bash
python3 scripts/collect_gps_scene.py
```

Script description:
- Coordinate source: **uses /fix only**
- Sampling: 10 samples per point, averaged
- Quality threshold: sample spread < 2 m, otherwise collection is rejected
- Output file: `~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/gnss/scene_gps_bundle.yaml`
- A single file simultaneously maintains:
  - fixed origin
  - graph nodes
  - `anchor`
  - `dest`
  - edges

Interactive commands:
- `Enter`: collect a map point
- `e`: add an edge between two points, treated as bidirectional
- `o`: select a fixed origin from existing points
- `u`: modify name / anchor / destination of an existing point
- `l`: list all points and edges, showing anchor / dest / origin
- `d`: delete a specific point by ID
- `q`: save and exit

Compile runtime files after collection:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_scene_runtime.py
```

QGIS route-network import flow, for example `/Users/badger/Desktop/maps/qgis_4_package/3.geojson`:

```bash
python3 scripts/compile_qgis_scene.py \
  --input /Users/badger/Desktop/maps/qgis_4_package/3.geojson \
  --scene-name qgis_4 \
  --densify-step-m 5.0 \
  --output ~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/gnss/scene_gps_bundle.yaml

python3 scripts/build_scene_runtime.py
```

`compile_qgis_scene.py` converts `feature_type=route` LineStrings into a scene graph, densifies route edges to at most 5m, and writes usable destinations into `scene_gps_bundle.yaml`. For the current `qgis_4_package/3.geojson`, the default output is about `557` route nodes, `558` edges, and these initial destination families: `math_building`, `environment_building`, `route_end_*`, and `junction_*`.

Collection guidelines:
- All turns, intersections, and destination entrances must have waypoints
- Areas where the system may be powered on must have nearby `anchor` points
- Graph edges are understood as straight-line segments between nodes; curves must be discretized by adding more nodes
- The script will prompt whether to automatically create an edge with the previous point

## 13. GPS Navigation Debugging

```bash
# Launch nav-gps
make launch-nav-gps

# View scene destination list
ros2 run gps_waypoint_dispatcher list_destinations

```

Runtime notes:
- After modifying or importing a new QGIS/scene map, rerun `python3 scripts/build_scene_runtime.py` so `master_params_scene.yaml` records the scene fixed origin plus `rtk_map_odom_corrector`'s `scene_points_file` and `use_scene_identity_alignment=true`.
- `nav-gps` does not require the vehicle to start near an anchor before accepting a destination; the goal manager reads the current `map->base_link` pose and sends `ComputeRoute(use_poses=true)` so the route server starts from the nearest traversable graph node.
- `route_server` runs with `enable_nn_search=true` in `nav-gps`, so as long as the vehicle is near the route network, the start pose is snapped to the nearest traversable graph node and the route follows the graph to the destination.
- `nav-gps` now reuses the corridor RTK-authoritative chain: PGO disables `publish_tf` and GPS factors, while `rtk_map_odom_corrector` is the only `map->odom` owner.
- Nav2 uses the corridor RTK MPPI profile and the high-window `/fastlio2/body_cloud_nav2_obstacles` obstacle cloud; the older DWB-based `nav2_gps.yaml` profile is no longer the vehicle entry point for destination-by-name navigation.
- The RTK FGO shadow node starts by default with `publish_tf=false` and `nav2_use_fgo=false`; set `FYP_NAV_GPS_ENABLE_FGO_SHADOW=false` to disable it.
- The default lean bag records RTK, FAST-LIO2 odom, Livox IMU, chassis `/odom_CBoar`, `/rtk_fgo/*`, TF, GPS/goal status, costmaps, `/cmd_vel`, and `/plan`; use `FYP_NAV_GPS_BAG_PROFILE=debug` only when raw point-cloud replay is needed.
- On the vehicle, prefer `FYP_USE_RVIZ=false bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh nav-gps` to avoid spending Jetson resources on RViz.

## 14. Fixed-Launch GPS Corridor

### GPS Route Collection (Waypoint Survey)

```bash
python3 scripts/collect_gps_route.py
```

Interactive workflow:
1. Enter route name
2. Place the vehicle at the start point, press Enter to collect `start_ref` (10 samples, spread < 2 m)
3. Move to each waypoint sequentially, press Enter to collect
   - After each point, ENU coordinate preview and spread are displayed
   - `Accept / Retry? [A/r]` -- poor signal allows immediate re-collection
   - Altitude anomalies (> 10 m jump) trigger automatic warnings
4. Confirm `launch_yaw_deg` (auto-suggested if first segment > 5 m, otherwise manual input)
5. Route summary table displayed before saving (segment distances, bearings, ENU coordinates)
6. Confirm save -> `~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/gnss/current_route.yaml`

### Automatic Corridor Navigation

```bash
bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh corridor
```

One-line launch with RTK/CORS parameters for field testing:

> Do not commit the real CORS password. Use `make ntrip-login` in the Jetson to handle CORS credentials.

```bash
FYP_USE_RVIZ=false FYP_CORRIDOR_CONSOLE_MODE=quiet bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh corridor
```

Confirm the route that will be used before launching:

```bash
sed -n '1,120p' runtime-data/gnss/current_route.yaml
```

Clean up residual processes after completion:

```bash
make kill
```

Makefile shortcut launch:

```bash
make launch-corridor
```

Debug observation:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /gps_corridor/status
ros2 topic echo /gps_corridor/goal_map
ros2 topic echo /gps_corridor/path_map
ros2 topic echo /gps_corridor/enu_to_map
```

Check whether the default automatic corridor bag contains the lean RTK / FAST-LIO2 / FGO shadow / Nav2 diagnostic topics:

```bash
ros2 bag info runtime-data/logs/latest/bag | grep -E '/fix|/heading|/rtk/status|/rtk/nmea_sentence|/fastlio2/lio_odom|/livox/imu|/odom_CBoar|/rtk_fgo|/cmd_vel|/plan'
```

If raw Livox replay is needed, opt in to the heavier debug bag profile before launch:

```bash
FYP_CORRIDOR_BAG_PROFILE=debug FYP_USE_RVIZ=false FYP_CORRIDOR_CONSOLE_MODE=quiet bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh corridor
ros2 bag info runtime-data/logs/latest/bag | grep -E '/livox/lidar|/fastlio2/body_cloud'
```

Notes:
- This mode assumes the vehicle is already placed at the fixed Launch Pose with the heading aligned
- `collect_gps_route.py` collects `start_ref + multiple key waypoints` and generates `~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/gnss/current_route.yaml`
- If `collect_gps_route.py` does not detect `/fix`, it automatically launches `nmea_navsat_driver` in the background and stops it after collection
- The collection process explicitly confirms `launch_yaw_deg`; if the start point is too close to the first waypoint, manual input is required
- Default subgoal spacing is 5 m, automatically written to the route file during collection; long RTK route legs are split into short subgoals to reduce rolling-costmap and local-tracking coupling risk
- At runtime, no menu appears and no additional commands are awaited
- The wrapper writes logs and bags to `~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/logs/<session>/`
- Corridor currently generates a temporary Nav2 parameter file from `nav2_corridor_rtk.yaml` at launch time and applies the RTK-authoritative corridor profile: `vx_max=0.85`, `wz_max=0.70`, `ax_max=0.85`, `ax_min=-1.2`, `az_max=1.4`, `temperature=0.45`, `regenerate_noises=true`, `failure_tolerance=1.5s`, `controller_frequency=20Hz`, and `batch_size=500`; the local costmap is near-field `12m x 12m`, STVL marking uses `obstacle_range=5m`, and `CostCritic.cost_weight=7.0`; MPPI keeps `model_dt=0.05s`, so the control period must not be larger than the model step and cannot be lowered to `15Hz`
- After the final waypoint is reached, `gps_route_runner` publishes `STOPPING_BEFORE_EXIT`, holds zero `/cmd_vel` for 1.2s at 20Hz, then publishes `SUCCEEDED`; quiet mode exits only after this hold, so the bag should contain a visible zero-speed tail.
- Corridor starts the RTK FGO shadow node by default, with `publish_tf=false` and `nav2_use_fgo=false`, so it does not own `map->odom` or feed Nav2; set `FYP_CORRIDOR_ENABLE_FGO_SHADOW=false` to disable it
- The default corridor bag uses the lean profile and records RTK, FAST-LIO2 odom, Livox IMU, chassis `/odom_CBoar`, `/rtk_fgo/*`, TF, corridor status, goals, costmaps, `/cmd_vel`, and `/plan`; raw Livox point cloud, `/fastlio2/body_cloud`, and `/fastlio2/body_cloud_nav2_obstacles` are recorded only with `FYP_CORRIDOR_BAG_PROFILE=debug`
- Livox packet-scale console/CSV logging is disabled during normal runs. Use `LIVOX_VERBOSE_PACKET_LOGS=1` only for short bench diagnostics because it prints and flushes per packet.
- During startup, if the current `/fix` deviates from `start_ref` beyond tolerance, `gps_route_runner` will abort immediately without moving the vehicle
- **Ctrl+C automatically cleans up all nodes, ros2 daemon, and serial port occupancy** -- no need for manual `make kill-runtime`

**Quiet mode** (default):
- Only simplified status messages are shown in the foreground
- Full launch output is written to `~/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/logs/<session>/system/launch_stdout.log`
- Default startup timeout is 45 s, adjustable via the `FYP_CORRIDOR_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_S` environment variable

**Raw mode** (for debugging):
```bash
FYP_CORRIDOR_CONSOLE_MODE=raw bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh corridor
```

## RTK FGO Tight-Coupled Shadow Mode

Build:

```bash
make build-perception
ss
```

Launch the experimental shadow mode:

```bash
make launch-tightly-coupled
FYP_USE_RVIZ=false bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh tightly-coupled
```

Launch with field RTK/CORS parameters:

```bash
FYP_RTK_PARAMS_FILE=/tmp/um982_cors.yaml FYP_USE_RVIZ=false bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh tightly-coupled
```

Observe shadow outputs:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /rtk_fgo/status
ros2 topic echo /rtk_fgo/rtk_gate
ros2 topic echo /rtk_fgo/correction_status
ros2 topic echo /rtk_fgo/factor_diagnostics
```

Check chassis feedback and bag capture:

```bash
ros2 topic hz /cmd_vel
ros2 topic hz /odom_CBoar
ros2 topic echo /odom_CBoar --once
ros2 bag info runtime-data/logs/latest/bag | grep -E '/odom_CBoar|/cmd_vel|/fix|/heading|/rtk_fgo|/pgo/optimized_odom|/pgo/loop_markers|/livox/lidar|/fastlio2/body_cloud'
tail -f runtime-data/logs/latest/data/serial_reader.log
```

Generate replay metrics from the latest tightly-coupled bag:

```bash
python3 scripts/evaluate_rtk_fgo_bag.py \
  --bag runtime-data/logs/latest/bag \
  --out runtime-data/logs/latest/system/rtk_fgo_metrics.json
```

Experimental TF must be enabled explicitly and only for guarded tests:

```bash
ros2 launch bringup system_tightly_coupled.launch.py publish_fgo_tf:=true nav2_use_fgo:=false
```

Notes:
- This mode defaults to `publish_tf=false` and does not broadcast production `map -> odom`
- Nav2 is not remapped, and `corridor`, `explore-gps`, and `nav-gps` are not replaced
- The automatic bag includes `/rtk_fgo/*`, `/fix`, `/heading`, `/rtk/status`, `/rtk/nmea_sentence`, `/livox/lidar`, `/livox/imu`, `/fastlio2/lio_odom`, `/fastlio2/body_cloud`, `/pgo/optimized_odom`, `/pgo/loop_markers`, and `/tf`
- `/rtk_fgo/factor_diagnostics` includes frame-anchor, wheel-factor, and graph-window health keys

## NTRIP Account Setting

When using the RTK antenna, the robot must have an NTRIP account to receive full-quality signal. These can be bought in Taobao, for example in here: https://e.tb.cn/h.Ry4kJCGRkkS8a8n?tk=VpOEgN1OG2z

In addition, this repo counts with a script that handles these credentials.

To login onto an NTRIP account, run:
```bash
make ntrip-login
```

To change the account parameters, such as the server IP and mountpoint, run:
```bash
make ntrip-setup
```

To check current credentials and connection test, run:
```bash
make ntrip-status
```

To log out, run:
```bash
make ntrip-logout
```

Equivalent wrapper direct invocation:
```bash
@python3 scripts/setup_ntrip.py
@python3 scripts/setup_ntrip.py --setup
@python3 scripts/setup_ntrip.py --status
@python3 scripts/setup_ntrip.py --logout
```

Once logged in, the credentials are stored in the robot. You will be logged in automatically every time until you manually log out or change the credentials.

## Foxglove

### Initial Setup

On your personal computer:
1. Create an account at https://app.foxglove.dev/signin
2. Download Foxglove https://foxglove.dev/download

In the Jetson, download Foxglove:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-foxglove-bridge
```

### Live Travel Indoor Navigation

Travel starts Foxglove Bridge and the guarded navigation adapter by default, so a second bridge process is not required:

```bash
FYP_USE_RVIZ=false FYP_USE_FOXGLOVE=true \
  bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh travel \
  map_bundle:=/home/badger/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_id>
```

Pass `foxglove_port:=8766` if the default port is occupied. To disable the Bridge temporarily:

```bash
FYP_USE_FOXGLOVE=false bash scripts/launch_with_logs.sh travel \
  map_bundle:=/home/badger/XJTLU-autonomous-vehicle/runtime-data/maps/indoor/<map_id>
```

Import the repository layout into Foxglove on first use:

```text
src/bringup/foxglove/indoor_navigation.json
```

The layout includes the 3D map, robot, point clouds, costmaps, path, safety zones, localization/navigation status, destination catalog, named-goal publishing, region relocalization, cancel, logs, and Topic Graph.

Controls:

- 3D `Publish -> 2D pose estimate` publishes `/initialpose` for manual localization fallback.
- The repository layout's 3D `Publish -> 2D pose` publishes `/foxglove/goal_pose`; Foxglove's default 3D layout commonly publishes `/move_base_simple/goal`. The same guarded adapter converts both into a Nav2 `NavigateToPose` Action.
- Edit `data` in `Navigate to destination` to a destination ID, display name, or alias; it publishes `/foxglove/named_destination`.
- `Relocalize in region` calls `/localizer/global_relocalize`; an empty `region` requests a whole-map search.
- `Cancel navigation` calls `/foxglove/cancel_navigation` and only cancels the goal owned by this adapter.
- `/foxglove/navigation/status` reports source, target, localization, remaining distance, and result; destinations appear as MarkerArray objects in 3D.

Safety gate: the adapter never reads or writes `/cmd_vel*`. The Bridge client-publish whitelist only permits `/initialpose`, `/foxglove/goal_pose`, `/move_base_simple/goal`, and `/foxglove/named_destination`, and parameter mutation is disabled. Both Pose inputs use identical localization/concurrency/Action gates. A goal is sent only when `/localizer/status` is `LOCALIZED` with `localized=true` and `sensors_ready=true`; degradation cancels it, while the independent velocity gate still enforces zero output.

### Manual Bridge Start (Other Modes)

To start a connection, SSH into the Jetson and run:
```bash
ros2 run foxglove_bridge foxglove_bridge
```

Then from your computer, open Foxglove and click on "Open Connection" -> "Foxglove WebSocket (default)" and enter `ws://100.79.128.22:8765`

Foxglove Bridge has no project-level login authentication. Only expose it on a controlled LAN or Tailscale network; never publish port `8765` to the public internet.

After entering, click anywhere on the center view, and the left panel will load many options. This may take some time, up to a minute.

**Note**: the Tailscale IP may be slightly different per account. If you are not sure about the correct IP:
1. Open another terminal in the Jetson and run: `tailscale ip -4`
2. Open Tailscale from your computer or the [browser](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) and check the robot address "badger"
3. Go back to Foxglove and type the correct IP address in here: `ws://<TAILSCALE_IP>:8765`

#### Foxglove Settings

To correctly render the robot URDF along with other data, such as the point cloud, use the following settings:
- Fixed frame: `<Root frame>`
- Display frame: `base_link`
- Follow mode: `Pose` (position + attitude)
- Sync timestamps: `Off`
- Location topic: `Auto`
- ENU frame: `<Fixed frame>`
- Grid Frame: `base_footprint`

### Debugging

Cannot connect:
- Double-check the Tailscale address is correct, and you have Tailscale on
- Ping the Jetson with the tailscale address from your computer with `ping <TAILSCALE_IP>`
- If using a VPN, go to your proxy settings and add all Tailscale IPs to the exception list: `100.*.*.*` (or try turning your VPN off and connecting again)
- If using Clash verge:
  1. Go to Settings -> System Proxy, click on the gear icon
  2. Set `Always use Default Bypass` to OFF
  3. A text input box should appear in the bottom (below `Proxy Bypass Settings`). Type this IP: `100.64.0.0/10`, then click on the NEW button, then SAVE.
  4. Go bach to the Settings page, look for "Tun Mode", click on the gear icon
  5. In the bottom text input box (below `Route Exclude Address`), type the same IP: `100.64.0.0/10`. Click on NEW, then SAVE.
  6. Go back to Foxglove and try again.

Connection too slow:
- Change the Jetson WiFi to your phone hotspot and ping it again

Topics not rendering properly (URDF or point cloud missing):
- Make sure in `Panel` -> `Topics`, the topics `/fastlio2/world_cloud` and `/robot_description` are visible (click on the eye icon)
- Close the current foxglove session and open another one, it usually fixes itself

## `~/.bashrc`

This script runs whenever a terminal is opened in the jetson (including SSH). We have modified it to include common commands and give us an overview of the robot's current state.

The script is being tracked in [/scripts/.bashrc](/scripts/.bashrc). To set it up in the Jetson:

1. Copy the script in [/scripts/.bashrc](/scripts/.bashrc) into your clipboard
2. Open a terminal in the Jetson (SSH or local are both ok)
3. Type the following command to open `~/.bashrc` with Vim:
```bash
rc
```
4. After it opens, type `:%d` to delete all contents in the file
5. Use `Ctrl + V` to paste the new script from your clipboard
6. Press `Esc`, then `:wq` to write and quit (save and exit)
7. To test it, run: `s1`

Whenever you want to update `~/.bashrc`, modify it first from [/scripts/.bashrc](/scripts/.bashrc), then follow the steps above to make sure we keep track of the file. Do not modify it in the Jetson without tracking it in this repo.
